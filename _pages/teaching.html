  <p>
    I have broad teaching experience across both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, covering core topics in control theory,
    automation, and nonlinear systems. In addition to delivering lectures and supervising laboratory and project-based learning, 
    I have supervised numerous undergraduate and MSc research projects, fostering students’ independent research and technical development. 
    eyond teaching, I have taken on significant academic service and leadership responsibilities, 
    including programme directorship and academic leadership roles in student societies and laboratory management.
    These experiences have strengthened my commitment to high-quality teaching, student engagement,
    and the continuous enhancement of engineering education.
